# personal-site
This is a personal website that I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is still a work in progress, as I am constantly learning and looking for ways to improve it.

My goal with this website is to showcase my skills, experiences, and interests to potential employers, collaborators, and friends. I also hope to use it as a platform to share my thoughts and projects with a wider audience.  I have included four main sections to give visitors a comprehensive understanding of who I am:
- Home page: provides an introduction to the website and what I do.
- About page: offers more detailed information about my background, experiences, and skills.
- Skills page: highlights my abilities and areas of expertise.
- Contact page: provides visitors with various ways to connect with me.
